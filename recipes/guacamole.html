    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are few things as easy, healthy, and delicious as this ubiquitous dip. However, unless you're grinding your
        aromatic vegetation in a molcajete, or against a cutting board, you're really not tasting a classic guacamole.
        The flavors not only become more intense, but actually change in character. This is just what those bland,
        fatty,
        but delectable avocados need. That and a thoughtful seasoning of lime juice, and maybe some more salt.
